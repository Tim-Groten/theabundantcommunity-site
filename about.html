    <h1>About Abundant Community</h1>

    <div class="quote">
      <p><strong>Abundant Community</strong> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit based in Houston, working to remove barriers for individuals with complex needs by unlocking our city’s untapped social and relational capital. We focus on building lasting relationships for people who often have none, starting with youth aging out of foster care. Our approach bridges two disconnected communities, those with few resources and those with unused abundance. By equipping volunteers and fostering community connections, we make it easier for people to show up for each other, and help move others from material, social, and relational poverty to abundance.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The challenges we address</h2>
    <p>Many young adults exiting foster care do not have close personal relationships to rely on. They may not have anyone to call for help with daily challenges, whether it is a ride to a job interview or child care during a doctor’s appointment. They also lack connections to networks that provide guidance, opportunity, and access to specialized help. At the same time, many people, congregations, and community groups want to help, yet they lack a clear, sustainable path to do so.</p>

    <h2>Our approach</h2>
    <p>We build an abundant community by forming partnerships in three areas. We work with <strong>referral partners</strong>, organizations in close contact with youth aging out of care. We collaborate with <strong>training partners</strong>, including <a href="https://www.theopentable.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Open Table</a>, a research-backed model that equips volunteers to serve people with complex needs. We engage <strong>community partners</strong>, from friend groups and faith communities to business networks, inviting people to use their social connections and resources to empower those without them.</p>

    <h2>Why this matters, evidence</h2>
    <p>During the transition to adulthood, <strong>11–36%</strong> of youth who age out experience homelessness, <a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Journal of Public Health</a>. In the Midwest Study, <strong>31–36%</strong> reported at least one episode of homelessness by age 26, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3969135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Courtney et al.</a>. Each year, approximately <strong>19,000 to 24,000</strong> young people age out of foster care in the United States, <a href="https://www.aecf.org/blog/what-happens-to-youth-aging-out-of-foster-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annie E. Casey Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIH/PMC</a>.</p>

    <h2>What comes next</h2>
    <p>We begin with youth aging out of foster care in Houston, then, as we learn and build capacity, we plan to expand our efforts to serve people experiencing homelessness. Our aim is lasting pathways out of material, social, and relational poverty, sustained by community.</p>
